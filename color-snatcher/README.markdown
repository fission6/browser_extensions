# Color Snatcher Safari Extension

Provides similar functionality as [Colorzilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/colorzilla/) for Firefox.

## Note
*There are more robust extensions currently out that solve this issue for Safari. I built this a long time ago when this extension did not exist. The code is here for learning and archival purposes. Feel free to use it if you'd like*

## Installation
Clone (or download) and compress folder to zip. Change .zip extension to .safariext

Or download from `http://www.ColorSnatcher.com/` (Website no longer exists)
